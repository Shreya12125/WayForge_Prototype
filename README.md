# Bangalore Transit Pipeline – WayForge Prototype

A real-time transit data pipeline for Bangalore that integrates BMTC (Bus) and BMRCL (Metro) data using Apache Kafka and Pathway Engine for intelligent route optimization.

The core idea of this project is to unify all modes of transport — public + private — into a single intelligent system.
For this prototype, we implemented public transit integration (BMTC + BMRCL).

# Overview

This system demonstrates a real-time transit data processing pipeline that:

Ingests static + live transit data from BMTC and BMRCL

Streams the data through Kafka for reliable message handling

Processes it in real time with Pathway Engine

Optimizes routes across multiple criteria (fastest, cheapest, eco-friendly, balanced)

Delivers real-time route recommendations with performance metrics

# Architecture

# Components

Producers → Ingest static + live data, publish to Kafka

Consumers → Subscribe to topics, process with Pathway Engine

Route Optimizer → Multi-criteria route computation

Demo Interface → Interactive CLI prototype for testing

Monitoring Layer → Logs, performance metrics, health checks

# Demo Features
System Health Check

Kafka connectivity validation

Data consistency checks

Status monitoring for all components

#Data Pipeline Management

Start/stop pipeline

Simulate real-time data streams

Monitor throughput + latency

# Route Planning Demo

Interactive location input

Optimized route suggestions in real time

Multiple optimization strategies

#Metrics & Monitoring

Error tracking

Processing latency + throughput

System activity updates

# Route Optimization Strategies

Fastest Route → Minimizes travel time, considers live delays + transfers

Cheapest Route → Minimizes fare cost, accounts for transfers + pricing

Balanced Route → Weighted optimization across time, cost, eco (best “all-rounder” choice)

# Data Formats

Static GTFS Data → Agency details, routes, stops, trips, calendar info

Live Position Data → Real-time vehicle/train locations, trip + timestamp metadata

# Performance Optimizations

Kafka Tuning → partition scaling, batch optimization

Memory Management → buffer limits, cleanup policies

Processing Speed → async pipelines, caching, connection pooling

# Testing

Unit tests for data parsing + route calculations

Integration tests for producer → consumer flow

Load tests for high-throughput message streams

# Security Considerations

No sensitive data in prototype

Local Kafka instance only

Proper logging + error sanitization

Role-based access at system level

# Future Enhancements
Planned Features

Eco-friendly Route → Prioritizes electric + metro transit, reduces carbon footprint

Integration of private vehicles (cabs, autos, EVs)

Real APIs from BMTC/BMRCL + private operators

Web Dashboard for live visualization

Mobile App for end users (React Native)

AI/ML Predictive Routing with demand forecasting

Multi-city support (scalable to other metros in India)

# Scalability

Kubernetes deployment for orchestration

Distributed Pathway clusters

Data lake for historical analysis

Stream processing with Apache Flink

# Acknowledgments

BMTC & BMRCL for transit inspiration

Apache Kafka for streaming backbone

Pathway Engine for real-time compute

GTFS for open transit data standards

This is just the prototype — future versions aim to unify all vehicles (public + private) into a single transit intelligence system for smarter cities.
